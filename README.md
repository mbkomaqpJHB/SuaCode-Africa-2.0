Course Project: Pong Game
This game has 2 paddles, one for each player and a ball. Once the ball starts moving, each player has one goal; to prevent the ball from exiting the vertical wall on his/her side. If that happens, the opponentâ€™s score increases. This course will introduce you to various programming concepts through the lesson notes, exercises, quizzes and assignments. You will work on assignments that will build on each other and eventually result in a fully-fledged pong game.
